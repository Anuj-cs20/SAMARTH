# SAMARTH
## What is Samarth ?
 SAMARTH stands for Smart A.I. with Multi-Functional Automation and Robust Task Handling 
 
 SAMARTH is a powerful and versatile A.I tool that could be used for a variety of tasks with near AGI capability
 
 It is a Browser Automation tool upon GPT-3 which does achieves objective set by user without any human intervention in between.
 
 This is the submission of team Code Crafters for the Warpspeed Hackathon held on 13th and 14th May 2023 at Bangalore.

 # Steps to Run :) 
 ### OpenAI
 The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from applications written in the Python language
 
 1. Run `pip install openai` in terminal.
 ### Playwright
 Playwright is a Python library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API.
 
 Run this two commands in  your terminal`pip install playwright` and after this `playwright install`
 ### Speech Recognition
 Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.
 
2. Run `pip install SpeechRecognition` in terminal.
 
 ## Open API Key
 You are required to have a Open API Key . You can find one at `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys`.
 
 Create a file name `openai_api_key.txt` in the same directory as our main python file and paste your Open API Key over there.
 
 ## Execution
 We are now all set with libraries and API Key. Now we proceed on to execute our `main.py`.
 
3. Run `python main.py` in your terminal from the file directory.
 
 Give the Objective/Task you want SAMARTH to do, and sit back and relax . Your task will be done automatically without any clicks, unless you have to give any login credentials to SAMARTH to proceed carrying out the task.
 
 
 ## Tech stack and Tools
 `Python`
 `GPT-3`
 `Replit`
 
 # Motivation !
 The initial idea was to create a fully automatic A.I tool to help find and book cabs efficiently.
