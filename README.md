 ## Open API Key
 You are required to have a Open API Key . You can find one at `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys`.
 
 Create a file name `openai_api_key.txt` in the same directory as our main python file and paste your Open API Key over there.
 
 ## Execution
 We now are all set with libraries and API Key. Now we proceed on to execute our `main.py`.
 
 Run `python main.py` in your terminal from the file directory.
 
 Give the Objective/Task you want SAMARTH to do, and sit back and relax . Your task will be done automatically without any clicks, unless you have to give any login credentials to SAMARTH to proceed carrying out the task.
 
 
 
 # Motivation !
 The initial basic idea was to create a A.I tool to help find and book cabs efficiently and fully automatic( except for the tasks where you need to login/give OTP
