 ### Open API Key
 You are required to have a Open API Key . You can find yours at `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys`.
 
  5. Create a file name `openai_api_key.txt` in the same directory as our main python file and paste your Open API Key over there.
 
 ### Execution
 We are now all set with libraries and API Key. Now we proceed on to execute our `speech.py`.
 
 6. Run `python speech.py` in your terminal from the file directory.
 
 Give the Objective/Task you want SAMARTH to do, and sit back and relax . Your task will be done automatically without any clicks, unless you have to give any login credentials to SAMARTH to proceed carrying out the task.
